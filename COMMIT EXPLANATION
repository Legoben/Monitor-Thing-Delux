COMMIT EXPLANATION:

Github only shows one commit for Pavan Gollapalli, totaling one line of code. 
In reality, my email was not set correctly: after running git config --global user.
email "pavankgollapalli@gmail.com", it started tracking my commits from then on.
None of my previous commits were tracked. I had several commits on the 
frontend; go to the files in the app/www directory to see my specific commits.
